# Portfolio Stephan Weber
This is the portfolio of Stephan Weber, a Programmer by passion.
It contains a collection of different games made by myself, sometimes together with friends.
It also contains some code examples.

Within this repository you can also find two .pdf files, one in English the other one in German.
In these files, you can read about the projects I included.
